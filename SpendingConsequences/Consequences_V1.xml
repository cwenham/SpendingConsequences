			<Commentary>The Compound Annual Growth Rate of the Standard &amp; Poor 500 Index since its inception in 1957 is 
				about <b>9.62%</b>, however this is not what you'll typically expect in any given year; in some years the index 
				does worse than others, some years it does much better. When investing in such a fund you should be thinking
				about the long term and be willing to ride-out dips in the market that can make it look as if you're losing

			<Commentary>The phrase "stuffing money under the mattress" might have come from the Depression era, when banks were failing and the FDIC (Federal
			Deposit Insurance Corporation) didn't exist yet.
			<br/>According to the Federal Reserve about one in every 12 families, or 8.7 percent of the US population, do not have a bank account. The majority of
			those are immigrants with low incomes who may be inhibited by a language barrier, or because they distrust traditional financial institutions.
			<br/>Another reason for going without a bank account, especially for low-income workers, are the fees: monthly service fees and overdraft fees are more
			common when you can't keep much money in your account at any time. Plus, the number of banks offering free checking accounts has dwindled rapidly since
			2008.</Commentary>

			<Configurable Name="Compounding" Type="String" Label="Compounded" Value="Monthly"/>
			<Commentary>The total payoff includes the principal plus the interest. This calculator assumes that you'll
				only make minimum payments, defined as the interest plus a percentage of the balance.
				Try increasing the <b>Percent-After-Interest</b> to see how much you'd save if you paid more each month.
				<br/>
				<br/>Making only minimum payments can force you to pay
				an enormous amount of interest over time thanks to <b>monthly compounding and low monthly payments:</b> even if 
				the interest rate is only 14% per year, putting $100 on a credit card does not mean you'll only ever to pay $14 
				in interest, in fact you may pay <i>much</i> more.
			<br/>The first trick they use, <b>monthly compounding</b> means that they calculate your interest and add it to
				your balance each month. That means that by the second month they're now charging you <i>interest on the
				interest.</i> Before the CARD act of 2009, some banks even charged more interest than the minimum payment
				could cover, creating an escalating debt problem called <i>Negative Amortization</i> that you can never
				escape from.
			<br/>The second trick is to make the minimum monthly payment as low as possible in order to <i>stretch out</i>
				the time it takes you to pay-off the card, sometimes to many years or decades. The longer you carry a 
				balance the more often they can use monthly compounding to charge you more interest.
			<br/>So what's the best way to use credit cards? Many smart shoppers pay-off their credit card balance in full
				each month, while it's still in the <b>grace period.</b> The grace period is when you can pay-off the balance
				of the card <i>without being charged interest</i>, and lasts for about 20 days after you use the card.
			<br/>Even if you can't pay the balance in full, every time you pay <i>more than the minimum balance</i> the extra
				amount will chip away at the <b>principal</b> balance, meaning that it bites-off more of the balance that
				they're using to calculate your interest the following month.

			<Commentary>The actual amount of money you can borrow will depend on your income, cash flow and credit history.
			What you see here is an estimate based on the <i>assumption</i> that you will qualify for such a loan, and
			is only meant to help you get an idea of what you could finance.
			<br/>Only your bank or financing company can tell you how much you can actually borrow and what kind of
			interest rate you qualify for. Most new-car loans tend to come with a lower rate than used-car loans because
			a new car will be covered by a manufacturer's warrantee, which lowers the risk to the lender. Your credit
			history will also affect the interest rate and maximum loan amount, as lenders are less willing to loan
			large amounts at low rates to those who may have defaulted on a loan in the past, or haven't yet established
			a good payment history.</Commentary>

			<Commentary>They say that a new car loses half of its value the moment you drive it off the dealer's lot,

			<br/>Used cars also tend to incur more <i>repair costs</i> and have a <i>shorter</i> lifetime, so while they 
			may be cheaper to buy initially, you need to be careful to balance price versus economy. If you plan to 
			drive the same car for more than 6 years, you may wish to consider a <b>new</b> car instead because	most of 
			your maintenance expenses will be covered by the warrantee. 
			<br/>Indeed, some studies have suggested that the most <i>economical</i> choice is to buy a new car and
