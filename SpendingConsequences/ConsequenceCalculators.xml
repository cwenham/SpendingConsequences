		<Commentary>The Compound Annual Growth Rate of the Standard &amp; Poor 500 Index since its inception in 1957 is 
			about 9.34%, however this is not what you'll typically expect in any given year; in some years the index 
			does worse than others, some years it does much better. When investing in such a fund you should be thinking
			about the long term and be willing to ride-out dips in the market that can make it look as if you're losing
			money.
