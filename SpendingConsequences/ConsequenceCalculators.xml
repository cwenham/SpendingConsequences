		<Commentary>The phrase "stuffing money under the mattress" might have come from the Depression era, when banks were failing and the FDIC (Federal
		Deposit Insurance Corporation) didn't exist yet.
		<br/>According to the Federal Reserve about one in every 12 families, or 8.7 percent of the US population, do not have a bank account. The majority of
		those are immigrants with low incomes who may be inhibited by a language barrier, or because they distrust traditional financial institutions.
		<br/>Another reason for going without a bank account, especially for low-income workers, are the fees: monthly service fees and overdraft fees are more
		common when you can't keep much money in your account at any time. Plus, the number of banks offering free checking accounts has dwindled rapidly since
		2008.</Commentary>

		<Commentary>The total payoff includes the principal plus the interest. This calculator assumes that you'll
			only make minimum payments, defined as the interest plus a percentage of the balance.
			Try increasing the <b>Percent-After-Interest</b> to see how much you'd save if you paid more each month.
			<br/>
			<br/>Making only minimum payments can force you to pay
			an enormous amount of interest over time thanks to <b>monthly compounding and low monthly payments:</b> even if 
			the interest rate is only 14% per year, putting $100 on a credit card does not mean you'll only ever to pay $14 
			in interest, in fact you may pay <i>much</i> more.
		<br/>The first trick they use, <b>monthly compounding</b> means that they calculate your interest and add it to
			your balance each month. That means that by the second month they're now charging you <i>interest on the
			interest.</i> Before the CARD act of 2009, some banks even charged more interest than the minimum payment
			could cover, creating an escalating debt problem called <i>Negative Amortization</i> that you can never
			escape from.
		<br/>The second trick is to make the minimum monthly payment as low as possible in order to <i>stretch out</i>
			the time it takes you to pay-off the card, sometimes to many years or decades. The longer you carry a 
			balance the more often they can use monthly compounding to charge you more interest.
		<br/>So what's the best way to use credit cards? Many smart shoppers pay-off their credit card balance in full
			each month, while it's still in the <b>grace period.</b> The grace period is when you can pay-off the balance
			of the card <i>without being charged interest</i>, and lasts for about 20 days after you use the card.
		<br/>Even if you can't pay the balance in full, every time you pay <i>more than the minimum balance</i> the extra
			amount will chip away at the <b>principal</b> balance, meaning that it bites-off more of the balance that
			they're using to calculate your interest the following month.

		<Commentary>The Compound Annual Growth Rate of the Standard &amp; Poor 500 Index since its inception in 1957 is 
			about <b>9.34%</b>, however this is not what you'll typically expect in any given year; in some years the index 
			does worse than others, some years it does much better. When investing in such a fund you should be thinking
			about the long term and be willing to ride-out dips in the market that can make it look as if you're losing

		<Commentary>They say that a new car loses half of its value the moment you drive it off the dealer's lot, but at the same time the loans for buying
		used cars tend to have a slightly higher interest rate over a shorter period of time (60 months for new cars, 36 months for used).
		<br/>Used cars also tend to incur more <i>repair costs</i> and have a <i>shorter</i> lifetime, so while they may be cheaper to buy initially, you need to 
		be careful to balance price versus economy. If you plan to drive the same car for more than 6 years, you may wish to consider a <b>new</b> car instead 
		because	most of your maintenance expenses will be covered by the warrantee. 
		<br/>Indeed, some studies have suggested that the most <i>economical</i> choice is to buy a new car and drive it until it falls apart.</Commentary>
